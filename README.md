👋 Hi, I’m Gerald and I do this.

🔮 [Quantum Computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing) opens up new realms of computability.

🔒 [Post-Quantum Cryptography](https://www.etsi.org/technologies/quantum-safe-cryptography) and [Cryptographic Agility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_agility) uphold our trust in computer systems.

🦀 The [Rust Programming Language](https://www.rust-lang.org/) enables us to create reliable, efficient, and comprehensible software.

🐋 [Cloud-Native Computing (aka containers)](https://www.cncf.io/) and the [RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture](https://riscv.org/) free up computing in time and space, and make open source and open standards ubiquitous.

🌍 [Climate Change Mitigation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_mitigation) through renewable energy and sustainable economy are the top goals of this century.

🌱 I’m currently learning [Go](https://go.dev/).

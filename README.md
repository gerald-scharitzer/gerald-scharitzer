ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Gerald.

ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in quantum computing, [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/), [RISC-V architecture](https://riscv.org/), climate change mitigation, and [container (aka cloud-native) computing](https://www.cncf.io/).

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Jupyter, pandas, and Python.
